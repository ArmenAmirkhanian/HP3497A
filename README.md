# HP3497A

This code uses the serial port (yes, they still exist) on the computer to remotely connect and collect data from an HP3497A digital multimeter unit. This particular type of unit is fairly old but still useful in certain settings. The code is specifically setup to read a certain number of strain channels and then write that data to a text file. The code is easily changed to perform a variety of measurements.
